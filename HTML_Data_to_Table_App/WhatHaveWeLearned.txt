Arrays -
A two-dimensional array is just an array of array values
This is why you can have a numeric/associative. Its a numerical array of associative arrays ex. $php_array[1]["Name"]
You can declare your array using another array.
-I have $php_array["ponies", "dragons"]
-I can declare the array $php_array2[$php_array[0], "saddles"]
-sizeof is the number of elements whether those are more arrays or just values
